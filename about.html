            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project is a <strong>Quiz Website</strong> developed as part of my college curriculum. 
                It is designed to provide an interactive platform for users to take quizzes on various topics, 
                track their scores, and improve their knowledge. The project is entirely developed by me, 
                <strong>Dhyan Shah</strong>, as a demonstration of my skills in web development and database management.
            </p>
            <p>
                The website includes features like user authentication, quiz selection, real-time scoring, 
                and a user-friendly interface. It is built using <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL</strong>.
